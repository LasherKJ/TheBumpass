# The Bumpass

The Bumpass is as simple a navigation app as can be. Input and select a destination and, like a compass, the Bumpass will provide simply an arrow. Unlike a compass, which always points to magnetic north, the Bumpass points to your selected destination. There is no turn by turn direction, there are no voice commands, or route options. Simply an arrow that points in a straight line from the device to the destination.

## Development

Currently the Bumpass uses Expo and React Native. Maps are provided by the Google Maps API.

## History
The Bumpass is an on again/off again project that has been in the works on for some time and gone through multiple iterations. The initial form was a Raspberry Pi Zero, GPS Module, E-Ink screen and cardboard box, but for ease of development and distribution has become an iOS app.
